    # This class implements a lock-free linked set. The general idea of this
    # implementation is this: each node has a successor which is an Atomic
    # Markable Reference. This is used to ensure that all modifications to the
    # list are atomic, preserving the structure of the linked list under _any_
    # circumstance in a multithreaded application.
    #
    # One interesting aspect of this algorithm occurs with removing a node.
    # Instead of physically removing a node when remove is called, a node is
    # logically removed, by 'marking it.' By doing this, we prevent calls to
    # `remove` from traversing the list twice to perform a physical removal.
    # Instead, we have have calls to `add` and `remove` clean up all marked
    # nodes they encounter while traversing the list.
    #
    # This algorithm is a variation of the Nonblocking Linked Set found in
    # 'The Art of Multiprocessor Programming' by Herlihy and Shavit.
